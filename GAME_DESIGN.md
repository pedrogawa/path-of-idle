# 🎮 Idle ARPG - Game Design Document

## Overview

An idle ARPG inspired by Path of Exile, featuring map progression, monster hunting, loot drops, and a deep crafting system.

---

## The Core Loop

The magic of idle games is **"numbers go up"** + **meaningful choices**:

1. **Visible Progress** - HP bars depleting, damage numbers, loot popping, kill counters
2. **Meaningful Decisions** - Gear choices, map farming strategies, crafting gambles

### Map Mechanics
- Each map has a **kill requirement** (e.g., 20-50 monsters) before boss can be challenged
- Boss fights are **manually initiated** (or auto-spawned after first clear)
- Normal monsters continue spawning even when boss is ready
- Higher maps = better item level drops
- Can **replay** any unlocked map for farming

## ⚔️ Combat System

### Damage Formula
```
Base Damage = Weapon Damage + Flat Damage Bonuses
Total Damage = Base Damage × (1 + %Increased Damage / 100)
Final Damage = Total Damage × Crit Multiplier (if crit)

Attack Rate = Base Attack Speed × (1 + %Increased Attack Speed / 100)
DPS = Average Damage × Attack Rate
```

### Defense Formulas
```
Physical Reduction = Armor / (Armor + 10 × Monster Level)
Elemental Reduction = min(Resistance%, 75%)

Evasion: Hit Chance = Accuracy / (Accuracy + Evasion / 4) [5%-100%]
Block Chance: % chance to negate physical damage (shields)

Damage Taken = Raw Damage × (1 - Reduction) × Variance(0.85-1.15)
Minimum Damage = 1
```

### Attributes
| Attribute | Effects |
|-----------|---------|
| **Strength** | +2 Life per 10 STR, +2% Melee Physical Damage per 10 STR |
| **Dexterity** | +2 Accuracy per 1 DEX, +2% Evasion per 5 DEX |
| **Intelligence** | +2 Mana per 10 INT, +2% Elemental Damage per 10 INT |

### Monster Types
- **Normal** - Base HP, base drops
- **Magic** (Blue) - 2x HP, 2x XP, better drops
- **Rare** (Yellow) - 4x HP, 4x XP, even better drops
- **Boss** - Unique HP pool, guaranteed drops, skill rotations

### Boss Mechanics
- Bosses have **skill rotations** with cooldowns
- Skills deal multiplied damage (2-3x base)
- Manual fight initiation after kill threshold
- Auto-spawn toggle available after first clear

## 🌳 Future: Passive Skill Tree

### Design Goals
- ~100-200 nodes for meaningful choices
- Starting area → Class specializations
- Notable nodes with powerful effects
- Keystones that fundamentally change playstyle

### Node Types
| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Minor** | +10 Life, +5% Damage |
| **Notable** | +30 Life, +15% Damage, special effects |
| **Keystone** | Major tradeoffs (e.g., "No Crits but +100% Damage") |

### Gain Points From
- Level up: 1 point per level
- Quest completion
- Ascendancy unlock

---

## ⚡ Future: Active Skills

### Skill Gems
- Socket into weapon/armor
- Level up with use
- Support gems modify active skills

### Example Skills
| Skill | Type | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Heavy Strike** | Attack | 150% damage, slower |
| **Cleave** | Attack | Hit multiple enemies |
| **Fireball** | Spell | Projectile, fire damage |
| **Frost Nova** | Spell | AoE around player |
| **Whirling Blades** | Movement | Dash + damage |

### Support Gems
| Support | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Added Fire** | +% fire damage |
| **Faster Attacks** | +% attack speed |
| **Multiple Projectiles** | More projectiles, less damage |

## 🗺️ Future: Map Modifiers

### Rolled Affixes on Maps
| Modifier | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **+% Monster Life** | Monsters tankier |
| **+% Monster Damage** | Monsters hit harder |
| **Elemental Weakness** | Player has -% resists |
| **% More Magic Monsters** | More blue packs |
| **Boss has X Skill** | Boss gains extra ability |

### Risk/Reward
- Harder mods = better drops
- "Juiced" maps for efficiency
- Corruption for extreme difficulty

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | Type safety, component model |
| State | Zustand | Simple, performant game state |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Fast iteration, utility-first |
| Backend | Supabase | Auth + Database + Realtime |
